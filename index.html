<p>
Plan well in advance to travel to Australia. There are many things to take into consideration and many things to get organized before you leave and when you get there. Here are some things you should get thinking about before you go.

<ul>
<li> What is the currency and where do I get it?</li>
<li> What transportation is available when I get there?</li>
<li>Should I stay in the heart of the city or further out?</li>
<li>What events are going on, farmers markets, shows, sporting events?</li>
</ul>
